# MSP Operations Kit

A complete Claude skill suite for running a small managed IT services business (MSP). Eighteen skills that work as one system: every client-visible number comes from one pricing skill, every piece of content follows one brand skill, and every legal-adjacent workflow carries an attorney escalation path.

Built and proven inside a working MSP, then white-labeled. The operational structure ships complete; the identity and the numbers are yours to fill in.

## Pay what you want

The kit is free and open to use. If it saves you time or wins you a client, [pay what you want via GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/RTFM-IT-Services-LLC). Any amount funds continued updates.

## What's inside

Setup:

- `msp-setup`: guided first-run setup. Interviews you for your facts, writes them into the other skills, tracks progress, and tells you when the kit is client-facing ready.

Foundation skills (the ones everything else defers to):

- `msp-brand`: your identity, colors, voice, and signature. A fill-in template; this is where you make the kit yours.
- `msp-sales`: outreach, call scripts, discovery, objection handling, pipeline, plus a 9-file reference library.
- `msp-marketing`: content engine and distribution playbook. Resources articles, social posts, licensed marketing-pack rewrites, idea bank, content log, and the channels-and-tactics playbook.
- `msp-leadgen`: prospecting research. Territory sweeps with a desk-scoring rubric, decision-maker identification, per-prospect contact plans, and first-touch drafts that feed the sales pipeline.
- `msp-pricing`: a pricing configurator with cost model references and a working quote script, plus the break-fix rate card, website build and Website Care pricing, and AI adoption project pricing.
- `msp-legal`: your document stack (MSA, Orders, SOW, DPA, waivers, and the website documents) and negotiation playbook.
- `msp-technical-writing`: prose form for everything that is not marketing or direct customer communication, plus the steps, troubleshooting, and technical process descriptions inside customer content. Based on ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Includes the `scripts/ste-lint.py` linter.

Services beyond managed IT (optional; turn them off during setup if you don't offer them):

- `msp-website-setup`: website builds (a side offering) on a standard pipeline for client static websites with git-based dev/prod deployment, always in a hosting account in the client's name. Website Care (monthly management of the client's own hosting, domain, and DNS) is a managed line item that can be a client's only managed service.
- `msp-ai-adoption`: client AI discovery, starter plans, workflow cards, and prompts for Copilot, Gemini, ChatGPT, or Claude. Sold as a fixed-fee project.

Delivery skills (day-to-day operations):

- `msp-onboarding`: 30-day runbook from Closed Won to steady state.
- `msp-offboarding`: client exit runbook, including website handover. Full service to the last day, never hold data hostage.
- `msp-helpdesk`: P1-P4 priority matrix, response targets, escalation, security incident track.
- `msp-maintenance`: patching, backup verification, monitoring triage, on-call, change management, and recurring Website Care work.
- `msp-client-comms`: operational message templates (maintenance, incidents, advisories, price changes, and more).
- `msp-qbr`: quarterly business review process and client scorecard.
- `msp-metrics`: monthly business review (MRR, margin per client, ticket load, SLA attainment) and the fire-or-fix framework.
- `msp-security`: security standards. The tiered client baseline (controls, verification, evidence), your own house standard as an MSP, compliance overlays for regulated verticals, assessments, and cyber insurance questionnaire rules.

## Install

As a plugin in Claude Code or Cowork (recommended, one step gets everything):

```
/plugin marketplace add RTFM-IT-Services-LLC/msp-claude-skills
/plugin install msp-ops-kit@msp-ops-kit
```

As a plugin file in the Claude app (no command line needed): [download `msp-ops-kit.plugin`](https://github.com/RTFM-IT-Services-LLC/msp-claude-skills/releases/latest/download/msp-ops-kit.plugin) from the latest release and upload it under Customize, Plugins. Every version is listed on the [Releases page](https://github.com/RTFM-IT-Services-LLC/msp-claude-skills/releases) with its changes. To build the file yourself from a copy of this repo instead, run:

```
git archive --format=zip -o msp-ops-kit.plugin HEAD .claude-plugin/plugin.json skills templates README.md LICENSE
```

When a new version comes out, download (or build) the new file and upload it the same way; the version number in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` tells the app it changed.

Or install skills individually in Cowork / claude.ai: zip a skill folder (the folder containing SKILL.md) and upload it under Settings, Capabilities.

## Setup

Ask Claude to "set up the kit". The `msp-setup` skill runs a guided, resumable interview that fills in your identity, rebuilds the pricing cost model with your numbers, walks every skill's Setup Decisions, routes `msp-legal` to your attorney, and finishes with a readiness check. It edits the kit source files in this folder, so keep this folder and reinstall the plugin after setup phases (if you installed from a plugin file, rebuild and re-upload it; commit your setup edits first, since the build command packages the committed state).

The skills work out of the box for internal drafting, but nothing should go client-facing until the readiness check passes. If you prefer manual setup, the five phases in `msp-setup/SKILL.md` are the checklist.

## Ground rules baked into the suite

Do not undo these; they are what makes the suite hold together.

- All client-visible numbers come from `msp-pricing`. No other skill states a price.
- Voice, naming, and formatting defer to `msp-brand`.
- Legal-adjacent content always carries the attorney escalation path.
- No em dashes in anything the suite produces.
