# Client Security Baseline: Full Control Checklist

**Defaults you must review:** the tiers, thresholds, and targets in this file are shipped
example defaults from a working MSP. Review and replace them with your own before anything goes
client-facing (see Setup Decisions in SKILL.md).

The detailed standard behind the short list in SKILL.md. Use it for onboarding assessments,
the annual assessment, hardening work, and answering "is this client where it should be?"

Tiers: **T1** = Baseline, every managed client, delivered inside the managed service.
**T2** = Recommended, quoted per client through msp-pricing. Regulated additions live in
`compliance-overlays.md`.

For every control, the assessment records: status (in place / partial / missing / waived),
evidence, and the date verified. "We think it is on" is not evidence. A screenshot, export,
console report, or log entry is.

Mapping note: controls track CIS Controls v8.1 Implementation Group 1 closely. When a client,
insurer, or auditor asks for a CIS mapping, build it from this list rather than claiming
blanket alignment.

## 10. Offboarding a Client's Staff Member

Same day as the departure (or the moment of an involuntary termination):

2. Reset the password and remove MFA methods.
3. Remove from admin roles, groups, and shared mailbox permissions.
4. Convert the mailbox to shared or set forwarding to the manager if the client asks (inside
   the organization only); reclaim the license per msp-pricing.
5. Transfer cloud file storage ownership to the manager.
6. Retire or wipe company data from mobile devices; collect hardware.
7. Remove from line-of-business apps and vendor portals {{COMPANY_NAME}} administers; flag the
   ones the client administers.
8. Rotate any shared credentials the person knew (Wi-Fi, shared accounts, alarm codes are
   the client's call).
